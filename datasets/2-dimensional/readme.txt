2-dimensional instances:
	A demand column was added to the instances of Caprara, A. and Toth, P. (2001). Lower bounds and algorithms for the 2-dimensional vector packing problem. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 111(3), 231–262.
	The instances are available in two file formats (txt and vbp).
	
	Each instance CL_X_N_Z.TXT / CL_X_N_Z.VBP is defined by
	- a class X (X = 1, 2, ..., 10);
	- the number N of items (N = 25, 50, 100, 200 for classes 1 to 9,
				 N = 24, 51,  99, 201 for class 10);
	- an identifier Z (Z = 1, 2, ..., 10).

	For each instance we report for the txt-file:
	- the weight and volume capacity of the bin;
	- N lines, each indicating, for each item, a progressive index, the demand, the weight and the volume.
	
	For each instance we report for the vbp-file:
	- the dimension
	- the capacity of the bin in all dimension;
	- the number of items;
	- N lines, each indicating, for each item, the weight of the item in all dimensions and the demand.
	
20-dimensional instances:
	A demand column was added to the instances of Brandao, F. and Pedroso, J. P. (2016). Bin packing and related problems: general arc-flow formulation with graph compression. Computers & Operations Research, 69, 56–67.

	Each instance CL_X_N.vbp is defined by
	- a class X (X = 1, 2, ..., 10);
	- the number N of items (N = 25, 50, 100, 200 for classes 1 to 9,
				 N = 24, 51,  99, 201 for class 10).

	For each instance we report:
	- the dimension
	- the capacity of the bin in all dimension;
	- the number of items;
	- N lines, each indicating, for each item, the weight of the item in all dimensions and the demand.
